Initial code for twitter bot.

Runs but will result in twitter account being suspended.

Update; 11th August 2013

Bot randomly "chooses" statuses to send from list initialised at the start of the code - should prevent/increase the time until the bot is suspended by Twitter.
TODO: Add whether the bot is doing a reply or a mention.
